# Nirvaana's: Zero Hunger Drive


This project is an under progress full-stack application that serves as a bridge between the Hotel industry and NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations), facilitating the efficient distribution of surplus food to those in need. This README will provide you with comprehensive information about the project's features.


## Introduction

We are committed to addressing food waste and hunger issues by connecting food establishments with surplus food to NGOs that can efficiently distribute it to the needy. The project offers two distinct dashboards: one for hotel businesses and another for NGOs. It enables hotel businesses to manage food items, access premium analytics, and communicate with NGOs in real-time. Simultaneously, NGOs can discover available restaurants, coordinate food delivery, and communicate directly with HoReCa businesses.

## Features incorporated till now

### NGO Dashboard

- **Authentication:** NGOs can create accounts and securely log in to access their dedicated dashboard.
- **Restaurant Discovery:** NGOs have the ability to view a list of restaurants offering surplus food for distribution.
- **Real-time Chat:** NGOs can directly communicate with HoReCa businesses through a real-time chat feature, simplifying the process of arranging food pickups and deliveries.
