## Introduction

NourishNet is committed to addressing food waste and hunger issues by connecting HoReCa establishments with surplus food to NGOs that can efficiently distribute it to the needy. The project offers two distinct dashboards: one for HoReCa businesses and another for NGOs. It enables HoReCa businesses to manage food items, access premium analytics, and communicate with NGOs in real-time. Simultaneously, NGOs can discover available restaurants, coordinate food delivery, and communicate directly with HoReCa businesses.
